This project was create for Summer School of Science in Višnjan, Croatia where I have participated as a project leader in 2012.

Students how participated this project were Jan Corazza, Dominik Skoko and Cseni Dobi.


Here is a the description of the project:

Ever wondered how machines can predict future events or things like your favorite song? The answer to this question is machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence. This scientific discipline is concerned with the design of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data. One of the most popular machine learning methods are neural networks, which imitate human brain, and two statistical methods - support vector machines and decision trees. There are a lot of applications for machine learning, such as detecting diseases, computer vision, predicting prices on stock markets. Detecting one person's taste is a typical machine learning problem: your list of favorite songs is used to recognize harmonical patterns that together make your taste for music. 

In this project, we will make a program that will learn all about your music preferences and, among a large set of songs, choose the ones that best suit your taste. For this we will use the programming language Python and one very intuitive machine learning method based on decision trees, called Random Forest. Also, we will study some parts of music theory to process our data and make it more knowledgeable. We will learn how to choose and prepare data, but also how to deal with a large amount of data. At the end, you will learn some statistical evaluation techniques which you can use to measure the efficiency of our method. We will try to keep the solution of the problem at a very general level, so, once you have implemented it, you can use it for other machine learning problems as well!


RUNNING THE PROJECT:

If you want to see the results of just one decision tree run tree.py
If you want to see the results of Random forest algorithm run forest.py
If you want to see the results of Genetic algorithm optimized Random forest run forestEvo2.py

Datasets for train are: correct_dataset and correct_dataset2 .
Datasets for evaluating are: test_Set and test_set2
